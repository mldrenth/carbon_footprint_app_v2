# carbon_footprint_app

## MVP

A user should be able to:

- submit values for various aspects of their lifestyle (e.g. diet, commute,  holiday habits, etc) and view their CO2 footprint. You'll need to create your own (simple) tested model to calculate this.
- update the values to see the effect on their CO2 footprint.
- view the CO2 footprint result in a visually interesting ways.

## Possible Extensions

- Show the CO2 footprint result before and after the user has updated the values.
- Compare themselves to an average
- Use intuitive inputs like sliders
- Send an email with their results
- Store their data in a database
- Have more options to input
- Change settings (where they are from etc.)
